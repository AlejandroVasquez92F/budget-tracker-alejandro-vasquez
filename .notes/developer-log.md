- i started some of the initial code and planning out what i wanted from my project.

# 9/11

- i started to flesh out the code to get some of my functions working.
- i met up with vanessa and went over how she keeps track of her budget.
- she shared a document with me on what she does and i'm planning out how to use some of that stuff.

# 9/13

- i got my tables to work with data input.
- i made a function that uses the stored user data to offer useful information about income/expense/savings.
- i also added a description for each transaction.

# 9/14

- i sketched out my wire frames as well as a small screen version and a large screen version.
- i'm going to focus on the large screen version to make this a bit easier on myself since i'm so short on time.

# 9/16

- i'm working on getting the main planned functionality working.
- i'm thinking i can spend tomorrow to get the styling done.
- i did some styling to help out with some of the weirdness of the layout which actually helped me fix a few bugs.
- i got most of everything working and even a bit of styling that really help the page look nicer.
- the last two features i need for mvp is persistent data and a way to delete/edit previous entries.
